HYTTIOAOA? ‚Äî Have You Tried Turning It Off and On Again?

A tiny VS Code extension that puts a one-click reload button in the Activity Bar.
Click the meme, VS Code reloads. After reload it briefly shows a ‚Äúworking‚Äù image for ~20s, then flips back to the meme.

Because sometimes the most powerful fix is‚Ä¶ rebooting the window. üòâ

Features

Activity Bar view named HYTTIOAOA? with a meme in a compact sidebar webview

One click = Developer: Reload Window (workbench.action.reloadWindow)

Post-reload status: shows working.jpg for a configurable duration, then returns to the meme

Optional command to reload without opening the view

How it works

Clicking the image posts a message to the extension.

The extension sets a short-lived timestamp in globalState and calls workbench.action.reloadWindow.

After VS Code restarts, the extension reads the timestamp:

If it‚Äôs still ‚Äúfresh‚Äù, the webview shows working.jpg and automatically switches back after the remaining time.

While working.jpg is visible, clicks are disabled to avoid accidental re-reloads.

Requirements

None. Standard VS Code API only.

Usage

Click the HYTTIOAOA? icon in the Activity Bar.

Click the image ‚Üí VS Code reloads.

After reload, a working screen appears for ~20s, then switches back to the meme.

Troubleshooting

The icon looks tiny: ensure your Activity Bar icon is an SVG with viewBox="0 0 24 24" and no extra padding; use fill="currentColor" or stroke="currentColor".

Clicking during the working screen: clicks are disabled intentionally until the timer ends, to prevent double reloads.

No image showing: verify files exist at media/have-you-tried.jpg and media/working.jpg, and that media is in webview.options.localResourceRoots.

Known Issues

If VS Code closes unexpectedly during the working phase, the ‚Äúshow until‚Äù timestamp may expire while it‚Äôs closed ‚Äî harmless; the next start will just show the meme view.

Security / Privacy

No telemetry.

No external network requests.

Uses VS Code‚Äôs globalState only for a short-lived timestamp.
